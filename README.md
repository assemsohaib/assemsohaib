## About

I build **AI-native systems** that bridge reinforcement learning research and production-grade software.  
My work focuses on **reproducibility, system design, and high-stakes decision-making environments**, where correctness, evaluation, and long-term maintainability matter.

I’m particularly interested in turning **research-grade AI** into **robust, scalable products**.

---

## Current focus

- AI-native collaboration tools for scientific and technical workflows  
- Human–AI interaction patterns for complex authoring and decision-making tasks  
- Reproducible experimentation pipelines for reinforcement learning systems
